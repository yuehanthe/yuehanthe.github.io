        <p>"I never thought I would be creating a club, but when I couldn't find the community I was looking for, I knew what I had to do. <br>
          Although I've always had a fascination with music, I only started playing clarinet second semester of 7th grade. From there, I struggled to find a place to create music outside of school band. That's why I created this club. It's a place for musicians of all levels to make connections with eachother and share music they love."</p>

        <p>"I am fluent bilingual that was a clarinet player in middle school. I played piano at the age of five, but failed miserably and don’t know how to play it anymore. In addition to the history of failed piano, I also have a history of failing violin, which I also don’t know how to play anymore either. Currently, I have a dream to become a percussionist."</p>

        <p>"I have played instruments since I was young. Though I have skipped around the many different types of musical genres, I ultimately found my place within the classical area. Being the eldest sibling has taught me more than enough responsibility, but whats one more project before college?"
